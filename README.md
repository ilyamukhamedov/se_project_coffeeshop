# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

The "Triple Peaks Coffee Shop" project is the second project in the TripleTen Software Engineering program. It was created using HTML and CSS based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5: The project utilizes semantic HTML elements to structure the content, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization.
- Flexbox: Flexbox is employed to create a flexible and responsive design that adapts well to various devices and screen sizes.
- Positioning: CSS positioning techniques are used to precisely position elements on the page, contributing to the overall layout and visual presentation.
- Flat BEM file structure: The project follows the BEM methodology for organizing CSS files, promoting clear and structured code.
- Custom form: The project includes a custom form, showcasing skills in web form development.
- CSS animation and transform: CSS is used to create animations and transformations for elements, adding interactivity and dynamism to the user interface.

## Plan on improving the project

### Future ideas:

1. The image of coffee shop in the header of the page has background which is visible when we changing width of viewport. I'm not sure for now if it's possible to solve that issue with using some styles to this image but i have an idea to delete background using Photoshop.
2. Create an infinite animation to the header logo for the arcs which will rotate in a circle hiding in the second half of the circle.
3. Instead of 'o' in header title- Specialty coffee we can add coffee bean with steam animation above it.
